# Causal Inference web application

This is a repository for a web interface built as part of a master thesis on “The Implementation of Causal Inference Methods on Business and Synthetic Data Using a Web Interface”. 

The web tool, built on streamlit, allows you to upload your timeseries and tabular data and work on it using causal inference models.
